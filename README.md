# Overview
This project accomplishes the mighty task of displaying a greeting from the computer to the world!

The software is written in C++ and prints "Hello World!" to the terminal.

I created this program to demonstrate my vast knowledge of everything C++. I'm sure Bjarne Stroustrup (a creator of C++) would be proud.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I developed this software on VS Code using C/C++ extensions installed. My Laptop is running Ubuntu 22.04. 
On that I can simply compile the program with g++
